## Get Delta
<div className="api-card">

`get_delta() → float`

Get the time elapsed since the last frame.

For stability, the returned delta is clamped so it will not be
smaller than 1/12 seconds (equivalent to capping at 12 FPS). This prevents
unstable calculations that rely on delta when very small frame times are
measured. This will not, however, clamp the value returned by `get_fps()`.

_**Returns**_

`float` : The delta time in seconds.

</div>

## Get FPS
<div className="api-card">

`get_fps() → float`

Get the current frames per second (FPS) measurement.

_**Returns**_

`float` : The current FPS value.

</div>

## Set Target
<div className="api-card">

`set_target(frame_rate: int) → None`

Set the target frame rate for the application.

_**Parameters**_

- `frame_rate` : The desired frame rate in frames per second (FPS). Values &le; 0 disable frame rate limiting.

</div>

## Get Elapsed
<div className="api-card">

`get_elapsed() → float`

Get the total elapsed time since the application started.

_**Returns**_

`float` : The elapsed time in seconds.

</div>

## Delay
<div className="api-card">

`delay(ms: float) → None`

Pause the application for a specified duration.

This function pauses execution for the given number of milliseconds.
Useful for simple timing control, though using `time.set_target()` is generally
preferred for precise frame rate control with nanosecond accuracy.

_**Parameters**_

- `ms` : The amount of time to delay in milliseconds.
