title: Keycode vs. Scancode
---

The Kraken Engine uses both keycodes and scancodes to handle keyboard input, but they serve different purposes.

Keycodes are the character that the key represents, while scancodes are the physical location of the key on the keyboard.
For example, the "Q" key on a QWERTY keyboard has a keycode of `K_q` and a scancode of `S_q`, whereas AZERTY keyboards would have a keycode of `K_a` instead.

Here's a comparison of when to use each:
| Scenario | Keycode (`K_`) | Scancode (`S_`) |
|-|-|-|
| **Menu navigation**                     | ✅ Works naturally with the user's keyboard layout            | ❌ Physical key positions may not match expected letters |
| **Text input**                          | ✅ Respects the user's language and layout (ideal for typing) | ❌ Breaks on non-QWERTY keyboards                        |
| **Gameplay movement**                   | ❌ Depends on user's layout (e.g., AZERTY vs QWERTY)          | ✅ Consistent physical keys across all layouts           |
| **Developer shortcuts / debug hotkeys** | ❌ May vary between keyboard layouts                          | ✅ Always maps to the same physical key positions        |
