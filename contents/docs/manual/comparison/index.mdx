## Detailed Comparisons

### PyKraken vs Pygame

*Pygame* is the most established Python game library, having been around since 2000.
This framework is how I got into Python and game development in general, with it being my go-to for many early projects.
It remains a popular choice for beginners due to its simplicity and large community.

**When to choose Pygame over PyKraken:**
- You want the largest community and most tutorials
- You need maximum compatibility (runs almost everywhere)
- You prefer total control with a lower-level API
- You're coming from a C/C++ SDL background

**Code Comparison** - Loading and drawing a sprite:

<p style={{marginBottom: -24}}><i>Pygame:</i></p>
```python showLineNumbers
import pygame as pg

pg.init()
screen = pg.display.set_mode((800, 600))
image = pg.image.load("sprite.png").convert_alpha()

running = True
while running:
    for event in pg.event.get():
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
            running = False

    screen.fill("black")
    screen.blit(image)
    pg.display.flip()

pg.quit()
```

<p style={{marginBottom: -24}}><i>PyKraken:</i></p>
```python showLineNumbers
import pykraken as kn

kn.init()
kn.window.create("Window", 800, 600)
texture = kn.Texture("sprite.png")

while kn.window.is_open():
    kn.event.poll()

    kn.renderer.clear()
    kn.renderer.draw(texture)
    kn.renderer.present()

kn.quit()
```

## Conclusion

**Choose PyKraken if**:
- You're building a 2D game (especially tile-based)
- You want modern features
- You prefer a structured but flexible framework
- Performance is important but you don't want to work at the Vulkan level

**Consider alternatives if**:
- You need 3D capabilities
- You want the largest community
- You want maximum low-level control
