title: How To Read the Docs
description: A guide on how to navigate and understand the Kraken Engine documentation.
---

The documentation is organized into three sections:
* **Manual**: Information like constants, implicit conversions, and more.
* **Classes**: Detailed documentation of all classes available in Kraken, including their methods and properties.
* **Functions**: Comprehensive list of all functions provided by Kraken.

### Navigating Classes
For nearly every class, you can write them in code as `kn.[ClassName]`.
For example, the "EasingAnimation" tab under the "Classes" section documents the `kn.EasingAnimation` class.

Just below the class description, you'll often find a list of constructor signatures.
These show you how to instantiate the class with different parameters.
For example, the `InputAction` class has five different constructors, one of which being `InputAction(gamepad_button: GamepadButton, slot: int = 0)`.

Meaning, the input action class can be instantiated as such:
```py
input_action = kn.InputAction(kn.C_WEST, slot=1)
```

### Navigating Functions
The "Functions" section is organized a little differently.
The name of the sections correspond to the submodule where the functions are located.
For example, the "mouse" section has a function called "is_pressed", which you can call in code as `kn.mouse.is_pressed()`.

<Note>
We like to use "kn" as the common alias for the PyKraken module throughout the documentation.
