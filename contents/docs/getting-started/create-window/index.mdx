title: Creating a Window
---

Congratulations on getting Kraken Engine installed!

This page aims to get you in the hang of launching your first window with in-depth descriptions of what each line means.

## Starter Code Snippet

```python:main.py showLineNumbers
import pykraken as kn

kn.init()
kn.window.create("Kraken Example", True)

while kn.window.is_open():
    kn.event.poll()

kn.quit()
```

### Breakdown

This simple program serves as a basic skeleton for applications built with the Kraken Engine.
Let's break down the key components that make this program function:

1. **Initializing Kraken Engine**
    - `kn.init()` prepares the underlying frameworks and features, ensuring the engine is ready to deliver everything it promises.
2. **Creating the Window**
    - `kn.window.create("Kraken Example", True)` creates the window with a size that fits the largest empty space on your screen.
3. **Looping and Event Polling**
    - The `while kn.window.is_open():` loop keeps the application running as long as the window is open.
    Inside it, `kn.event.poll()` updates internal event states like keyboard, mouse, and controller user input.
4. **Cleanly Quitting the Application**
    - Once the window is closed, exiting the main loop, `kn.quit()` safely shuts down the engine and frees any resources in use.

This template establishes a foundation for more advanced game logic and rendering.
