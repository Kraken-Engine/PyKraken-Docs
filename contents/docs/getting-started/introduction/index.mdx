Welcome to **Kraken Engine**!

Fast and lightweight, Kraken is a 2D videogame development framework built on top of SDL3.
It's designed to offer just the right balance between high-level convenience and low-level control, making it ideal for both hobbyists and experienced developers.

Whether you're crafting a minimalist arcade game or building a fully-featured side-scrolling adventure, Kraken gives you the tools to develop confidently and creatively.

##  Overview

Kraken expands upon SDL3 and other helper frameworks with a rich set of utilities tailored for game development.
It wraps common patterns into intuitive systems while keeping you close to the metal when you need to be.
Features include:

- **Unified Input System:** A clean abstraction over keyboard, mouse, and controller input with support for just-pressed and just-released logic, input rebinding, and axis detection.
- **Animation Controller:** Effortlessly manage sprite sheet animations with flexible frame control and transitions.
- **Tile Map Support:** Load and render Tiled TMX maps with support for layers, object groups, and tile flipping.
- **Pixel Array Manipulation:** Get opacity masks and create textures from scratch with rgb(a) multi-dimensional arrays.

## Planned Features

Kraken is still expanding.
The features below represent key milestones I plan to implement, all focused on giving developers greater control, speed, and creative range in 2D game development.
