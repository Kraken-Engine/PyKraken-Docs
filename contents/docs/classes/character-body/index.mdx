<Note type="warning" title="Experimental API">
  The physics submodule is a VERY experimental and new API that is highly susceptible to breaking changes in the future.
</Note>

Inherits from [Body](/docs/classes/body).

## Constructor
<div className="api-card">

- <ApiSig name="CharacterBody" params={[{ name: "world", type: "World" }]} returns="CharacterBody" />
</div>

## Properties
<hr style={{marginBottom: 0}} />

| Name | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `floor_max_angle` | Maximum angle (in radians) to consider a surface as a floor. Default is ~45 degrees. | <code>float</code> |
| `floor_snap_distance` | Distance in pixels to probe downward for floor detection. Default is 5.0. | <code>float</code> |
| `mass` | The mass of the character body. Default is 80.0. | <code>float</code> |
| `velocity` | The velocity of the character body. | <code><a href="/docs/classes/vec2">Vec2</a></code> |

## Methods
---

### Is On Ceiling
<div className="api-card">
<ApiSig name="is_on_ceiling" returns="bool" />

Whether the character is currently touching a ceiling.

</div>

### Is On Floor
<div className="api-card">
<ApiSig name="is_on_floor" returns="bool" />

Whether the character is currently on a floor surface.

</div>

### Is On Wall
<div className="api-card">
<ApiSig name="is_on_wall" returns="bool" />

Whether the character is currently touching a wall.

</div>

### Move And Slide
<div className="api-card">
<ApiSig name="move_and_slide" params={[{ name: "delta", type: "SupportsFloat", default: "-1.0" }]} returns="None" />

Perform movement and collision resolution for the character.

This method moves the character according to the velocity property and resolves
collisions by sliding along surfaces. It also updates the floor/ceiling/wall
contact states.

_**Args**_

- `delta` : The time step to use for movement.
                             Defaults to -1.0, which uses the frame delta.

</div>
