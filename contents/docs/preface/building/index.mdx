title: How to Build the Documentation
description: A guide on how to build the PyKraken Documentation locally.
---

This documentation site is built using Aria Docs and requires Node.js and pnpm to be installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js v18.12.0 or newer
  You can verify your Node.js version with:
  ```
  node --version
  ```
  Or install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

* pnpm (recommended package manager)
  If you don't have `pnpm` in your system, you can install it from [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  
  You can verify the installation of `pnpm` by-
  ```
  pnpm --version
  ```

  Other package managers like `npm`, `yarn` or `bun` can also be used but it is recommended to use `pnpm`.

## Clone the Repository

After setting up the prerequisites, clone the documentation repository-
```
git clone https://github.com/Kraken-Engine/PyKraken-Docs.git
```

Then `cd` into it-
```
cd PyKraken-Docs
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using pnpm:
```
pnpm install
```

## Start the Development Server

To start the local development server, run:
```
pnpm dev
```

Once the server starts, you can view the documentation in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
(If a different port is shown in the terminal, use that instead.)

## Troubleshooting

* Node version issues:
  Ensure your Node.js version is at least v18.12.0. Using tools like nvm is recommended for managing Node versions.

* Dependency errors:
  If you're facing any dependancy issues, use `pnpm` and delete the `node_modules` folder, then reinstall:
  ```
  rm -rf node_modules
  pnpm install
  ```
