title: What is a Shader?
description: An introduction to shaders and their role in graphics rendering.

**Shaders** are small programs that run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and are responsible for rendering graphics in a game or application.
They allow developers to control the *visual appearance* of objects by manipulating how they are drawn on the screen.

### Types of Shaders
Shaders are typically written in specialized programming languages such as *GLSL* (OpenGL Shading Language) or *HLSL* (High-Level Shading Language).
There are several types of shaders, but the most common ones are:
* **Vertex Shaders**: These shaders process each vertex of a 3D model, transforming its position in 3D space to 2D screen coordinates.
They can also manipulate vertex attributes like color, texture coordinates, and normals.
* **Fragment Shaders**: Also known as pixel shaders, these shaders determine the color and other attributes of each pixel on the screen.
They are responsible for effects like lighting, texturing, and color blending.
* **Compute Shaders**: These shaders are used for general-purpose computing tasks on the GPU, allowing for parallel processing of data.
They are not directly involved in rendering graphics but can be used for tasks like physics simulations, image processing, and more.

### Uniforms, Textures, and Buffers
Shaders often rely on external data to perform their calculations. This data can come in the form of:
* **Uniforms**: These are constant values that are passed to the shader from the CPU.
They can include transformation matrices, lighting parameters, or any other data that remains constant for a draw call.
* **Textures**: These are images or data that can be sampled by the shader to apply patterns, colors, or other effects to the rendered objects.
* **Buffers**: These are blocks of memory that store large amounts of data, such as vertex attributes or other information that the shader needs to access.
