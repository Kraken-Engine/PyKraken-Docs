title: Drawing Shapes
---

The Kraken Engine supports drawing various kinds of primitive shapes.
It can be useful when prototyping or grayboxing game mechanics before using textures.

## Rectangles
Rectangles are your simplest building block.
A `Rect` object stores x, y, width, and height values.
For example, let's draw a 50x30 rectangle with its top left corner placed at (100, 100).
```py
rect = kn.Rect(100, 100, 50, 30)
kn.draw.rect(rect, color=kn.color.WHITE)
```

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Result:</i></p>
<img src="/images/shapes-01.png" alt="A 50x30 rectangle drawn at (100, 100)" />

## Other Primitives
Alongside rectangles, we can also draw circles, lines, points, and polygons.
Lines can be great for **raycasts** or **debug guides**, and points could be used for **collision test spots** or **spawn locations**.
```py
# Draw a green line from (0, 0) to (200, 200)
kn.draw.line(((0, 0), (200, 200)), color=kn.color.GREEN)

# Draw a yellow point/pixel at (400, 300)
kn.draw.point((400, 300), color=kn.color.YELLOW)
```

## Clear, Draw, Present!
Both shapes and textures are drawn in the order you call them, which means a later drawing can override the pixels in the buffer of an earlier drawing.
If something covers another shape unexpectedly, check the order of your draw calls.
```py
while kn.window.is_open():
    ...
    kn.renderer.clear()
    kn.draw.rect((20, 20, 100, 100), color=kn.color.GREEN)
    kn.draw.rect((60, 60, 100, 100), color=kn.color.ORANGE)
    kn.renderer.present()
```

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Result:</i></p>
<img src="/images/shapes-02.png" alt="Two overlapping rectangles drawn to the screen" />
