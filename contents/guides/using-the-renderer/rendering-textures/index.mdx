title: Rendering Textures
---

Shapes are great for roughing out mechanics, but at some point you'll want real art.
That's where `Texture`s come in.

Textures are GPU-friendly images that you can draw, flip, rotate, and scale.
Think of them as a prepared image the GPU keeps on hand (VRAM).
You upload it once, then tell the renderer *where* and *how* to place it each frame.

## Creating Textures
Loading an image into GPU memory isn't free.
It's best to **load once and reuse** rather than creating textures on the fly:
```py
texture = kn.Texture("image.png")
while kn.window.is_open():
    # Use texture in here
```
<Note title="Beginner Tip">
If you need the same image multiple times (e.g. many enemies), reuse the same `Texture` object.
</Note>

## Drawing Textures
The simplest draw call renders the texture at the top left corner of the window, `(0, 0)`.
Though, because textures are drawn from their center by default, we need to specify the anchor point as `TOP_LEFT`.
```py
kn.renderer.draw(texture, anchor=kn.TOP_LEFT)
```

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Result:</i></p>
<img src="/images/basic-tex-draw.png" alt="A texture drawn at the top left corner of the screen" />

### Batching
Modern SDL3 backends (which we use) batch draw calls automatically if you draw the same texture consecutively.
This keeps the GPU from doing expensive state changes.
```py
# Best performance:
for i in range(5):
    kn.renderer.draw(texture, (i * 40, 200))

# Do sparingly:
kn.renderer.draw(texA)
kn.renderer.draw(texB)
kn.renderer.draw(texA)
```
*So, wherever possible, group similar textures together when drawing.*

## Transformations
Texture objects contain attributes for the angle it should render at in radians and whether it should be renderered flipped horizontally and/or vertically.
Below is an example that draws a texture regularly on the left and the same texture flipped horizontally and rotated 45 degrees on the right.
```py
while kn.window.is_open():
    ...
    # Draw normally (need to reset transformations)
    texture.flip.h = False
    texture.angle = 0
    kn.renderer.draw(texture, ...)

    # Draw horizontally flipped and rotated
    texture.flip.h = True
    texture.angle = math.pi / 4
    kn.renderer.draw(texture, ...)
    ...
```

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Result:</i></p>
<img src="/images/transformations.png" alt="Two textures drawn, one with transformations applied" />

## Atlases
If your game uses lots of small sprites (UI icons, sprite states, etc.), pack them into a single large texture called an **atlas**.
This means:
- Only one texture bind (fewer GPU state changes)
- Faster draws when sprites share the same atlas

The renderer accepts a source rectangle to select a portion of the texture to draw.
```py
heart_src = kn.Rect(0, 0, 32, 32)
power_src = kn.Rect(32, 0, 32, 32)
while kn.window.is_open():
    ...
    kn.renderer.draw(atlas_tex, (16, 16, 32, 32), src=heart_src)
    kn.renderer.draw(atlas_tex, (32, 32, 32, 32), src=power_src)
    ...
```

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Texture atlas:</i></p>
<img src="/images/atlas-01.png" alt="Source file of the texture atlas used" />

<p style={{marginBottom: 0}}><i>Result:</i></p>
<img src="/images/atlas-02.png" alt="Two textures drawn, one with transformations applied" />
