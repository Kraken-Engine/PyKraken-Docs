title: Rendering Textures
---

Shapes are great for roughing out mechanics, but at some point you'll want real art.
That's where `Texture`s come in.

Textures are GPU-friendly images that you can draw, flip, rotate, and scale.
Think of them as a prepared image the GPU keeps on hand (VRAM).
You upload it once, then tell the renderer *where* and *how* to place it each frame.

## Creating Textures
Loading an image into GPU memory isn't free.
It's best to **load once and reuse** rather than creating textures on the fly:
```py
texture = kn.Texture("image.png")
while kn.window.is_open():
    # Use texture in here
```
<Note title="Beginner Tip">
If you need the same image multiple times (e.g. many enemies), reuse the same `Texture` object.
</Note>

## Drawing Textures
The simplest draw call renders the texture at the origin `(0, 0)`.
Use a `Transform` to control position, rotation, and scale:
```py
# Draw at origin with default transform
kn.renderer.draw(texture)

# Draw with custom transform
transform = kn.Transform(
    pos=kn.Vec2(150, 100),
    angle=kn.math.to_rad(30)
)
kn.renderer.draw(texture, transform)
```

### Batching
Modern SDL3 backends (which we use) batch draw calls automatically if you draw the same texture consecutively.
This keeps the GPU from doing expensive state changes.
```py
# Best performance:
for i in range(5):
    transform = kn.Transform(pos=kn.Vec2(i * 40, 100))
    kn.renderer.draw(texture, transform)

# Do sparingly:
kn.renderer.draw(texA)
kn.renderer.draw(texB)
kn.renderer.draw(texA)
```
*So, wherever possible, group similar textures together when drawing.*


## Atlases
If your game uses lots of small sprites (UI icons, sprite states, etc.), pack them into a single large texture called an **atlas**.
This means:
- Only one texture bind (fewer GPU state changes)
- Faster draws when sprites share the same atlas

The renderer accepts a source rectangle to select a portion of the texture to draw.
```py
# Load the atlas texture
atlas_texture = kn.Texture("atlas.png")

heart_src = kn.Rect(0, 0, 32, 32)
heart_transform = kn.Transform(pos=kn.Vec2(16, 16))

power_src = kn.Rect(32, 0, 32, 32)
power_transform = kn.Transform(pos=kn.Vec2(32, 32))

while kn.window.is_open():
    ...
    # Draw heart icon from atlas
    atlas_texture.clip_area = heart_src
    kn.renderer.draw(atlas_texture, heart_transform)

    # Draw power icon from atlas
    atlas_texture.clip_area = power_src
    kn.renderer.draw(atlas_texture, power_transform)
    ...
```
