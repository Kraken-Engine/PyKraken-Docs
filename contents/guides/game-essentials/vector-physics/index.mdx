title: Vectors for Game Physics
---

Vectors are the backbone of game physics.
The `Vec2` class gives you everything you need for 2D movement, collision response, and spatial calculations.

## Creating Vectors

A `Vec2` represents a point or direction in 2D space.
You can create them with x and y components, or as a zero vector.

```python
position = kn.Vec2(100, 200)
velocity = kn.Vec2(-3)  # (-3, -3)
zero = kn.Vec2()  # (0, 0)
```

Access components with `.x` and `.y`:

```python
print(f"X: {position.x}, Y: {position.y}")
```

## Basic Movement

The simplest physics is moving an object by adding velocity to position each frame.
Multiply velocity by delta time to keep movement frame-rate independent.

```python
import pykraken as kn

kn.init()
kn.window.create("Movement Demo", (800, 600))

position = kn.Vec2(400, 300)
direction = kn.Vec2(1, 0)  # Moving right
speed = 200  # pixels per second

while kn.window.is_open():
    kn.event.poll()
    dt = kn.time.get_delta()

    # velocity = speed * direction
    # Optimization tip: Multiply the scalars first
    position += dt * speed * direction

    kn.renderer.clear("#222")
    kn.draw.circle(kn.Circle(position, 20), kn.color.WHITE)
    kn.renderer.present()

kn.quit()
```

## Normalizing Vectors

A *normalized* vector (unit vector) has a length of 1.
This is essential for consistent movement speed. Without it, diagonal movement is about **1.41x** faster!

```python
# Without normalization, diagonal is faster
direction = kn.Vec2(1, 1)  # length ≈ 1.414

# Normalize to get consistent speed
direction.normalize()  # new length = 1.0

# Now apply your desired speed
speed = 200
velocity = direction * speed
```

Use normalization whenever you need a pure direction without magnitude.

## Dot Product

The **dot product** tells you how aligned two vectors are:
- **Positive**: Same general direction
- **Zero**: Perpendicular (90°)
- **Negative**: Opposite directions

```python
forward = kn.Vec2(1, 0)
to_target = kn.math.normalize(target_pos - my_pos)

alignment = kn.math.dot(forward, to_target)

if alignment > 0.7:
    print("Target is in front")
elif alignment < -0.7:
    print("Target is behind")
else:
    print("Target is to the side")
```

## Cross Product (2D)

In 2D, the cross product returns a scalar indicating rotation direction.
Useful for determining which way to turn to face a target.

```python
a = kn.Vec2(1, 0)
b = kn.Vec2(0, 1)

# Positive, meaning b is counter-clockwise from a
cross = kn.math.cross(a, b)
```
