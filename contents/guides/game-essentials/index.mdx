description: Core concepts every Kraken developer should know - vectors, animation, text, and tweening.

Now that you've got a window up and can render things to the screen, it's time to learn the building blocks that make games tick.

## Vectors for Game Physics

Vectors are the backbone of movement, physics, and spatial calculations.
Learn how to use `Vec2` objects for velocity, normalization, reflection, and more.

## Animation Controller

Bring your sprites to life with frame-by-frame animation.
The `AnimationController` makes it easy to define clips, control playback, and build animation state machines.

## Fonts and Text

Display scores, dialogue, and UI with custom fonts.
Load TrueType fonts and render text efficiently.

## Using the Orchestrator

Create smooth tweens and complex animation sequences.
The `Orchestrator` interpolates values over time with easing, callbacks, and chaining.
