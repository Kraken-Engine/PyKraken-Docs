title: Installation
---

Before starting, ensure you have a [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version installed that is supported by Kraken Engine.

## Install via PyPI
To get started, you can install Kraken from PyPI using `pip`.
<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Download and Install From PyPI">
    Begin by entering the following command into a terminal:

    ```plaintext
    pip install kraken-engine
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Import Module Into an Editor">
    After installing, import the module into a code editor (I recommend PyCharm or VSCode):

    ```py
    import pykraken
    # Or the recommended way -> import pykraken as kn
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

You're now ready to start writing your first Kraken script!

### Updating
To update Kraken Engine to the latest version, use the following command:

```plaintext
pip install --upgrade kraken-engine
```
