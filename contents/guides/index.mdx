Welcome to **Kraken Engine**!

Fast and lightweight, Kraken is a 2D videogame development framework built on top of SDL3.
It's designed to offer just the right balance between high-level convenience and low-level control, making it ideal for both hobbyists and experienced developers.

Whether you're crafting a minimalist arcade game or building a fully-featured side-scrolling adventure, Kraken gives you the tools to develop confidently and creatively.

##  Overview

Kraken expands upon SDL3 and other helper frameworks with a rich set of utilities tailored for game development.
It wraps common patterns into intuitive systems while keeping you close to the metal when you need to be.
Features include:

- **Built-in Physics Engine:** A thin abstraction over Box2D v3, providing rigidbody dynamics, collision detection, and response with tunable forces.
- **Animation Controller:** Effortlessly manage sprite sheet animations with flexible frame control and transitions.
- **Tile Map Support:** Load and render Tiled TMX maps with support for layers, object groups, and tile flipping.
- **Fragment Shader Pass:** Apply custom GLSL/HLSL shaders to your entire scene for effects like lighting, color grading, and post-processing.
- **Transform Orchestrator:** Create complex, timeline-based animations for any Transform object, perfect for cutscenes, scripted events, or dynamic effects.

## Planned Features

Kraken is still expanding.
The features below represent key milestones I plan to implement, all focused on giving developers greater control, speed, and creative range in 2D game development.
